# Webpack Boilerplate

Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

This repository is intented to be a boilerplate for a quick start for my web development, I don't know how many repositories must be exist out the, but apart of be just another one is also a record of my learning in my dayly job and readings about web technologies.

This boilerplate is made for compile and build files using Webpack configured with Babel Bootstrap 4 and Sass.

This Boilerplate is inspired in this [post](https://hackernoon.com/a-tale-of-webpack-4-and-how-to-finally-configure-it-in-the-right-way-4e94c8e7e5c1) of [Margarita Obraztsova](https://hackernoon.com/@riittagirl)
